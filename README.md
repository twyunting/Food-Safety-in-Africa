## Food-Safety-in-Africa
Food insecurity is still a major global concern as 1 billion people are suffering from starvation and malnutrition, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has concluded that we are still far from reaching millennium development goal (MDG) Number 1: to halve extreme poverty and hunger. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of people suffering from hunger is estimated at over 200 million, and this figure could increase in the near future. In this project, we hope to answer certain questions with the data set we have and proffer possible solutions to bring about better Food security in Africa. We know Africa has rich resources when it comes to agriculture and rich soil, but they lack the proper equipment to harvest them is lacking. After this, we should be able to comfortably suggest measures to counter the gaping holes in infrastructure, food supply, hazard control, and questions that need answering.

The analysis is based on Global Food Safety Partnerships (GFSP) dataset from 49 countries between 2006 to 2017. We are interested in quantitative measurement for this project, especially we compared Africa's GDP and total population.
